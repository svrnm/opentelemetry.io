The OpenTelemetry Project consists of specifications, language specific implementations
of the APIs and SDKs, language specific zero-code solutions and other components like
for end-user facing documentation for **all of them**.

This is good for end-users, since they have a single point of entry into the OpenTelemetry
Project. For documenting all components of the project, this creates the demand for
standardization and consistency across components. Therefor the SIG Communications, which
is responsible for the website and documentation, has a content strategy in place that
outlines how content should look like, what examples should be used and how a consistent
documentation experience is accomplished.

This document summarizes the building blocks of that content strategy. You do not need
to read this document, if you want to start contributing to the documentation, but we
highly recommend it to you!

## Incremental changes

As a core principal we prefer changing the documentation in incremental steps instead
of doing large rewrites or overhauls in the background. Even large changes, like an
information architecture redesign can be implemented in small steps.
